# Cattoflix: Streaming for Cats

## What is Cattoflix?

Cattoflix is a streaming platform designed exclusively for our feline friends. Inspired by Netflix, we've created a website that offers a curated selection of videos cats love to watch, including birds, fish, and other enticing content for curious kitties.

## Why Cattoflix?

In a world where humans have countless streaming options, we felt it was time for cats to have their own dedicated platform. Cattoflix aims to entertain and stimulate cats, providing them with a safe and engaging digital playground.

## When was it developed?

This project was developed as part of a 13-day coding challenge from August 1st to August 14th, 2024.

## How it works

Cattoflix is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. It features a user-friendly interface that allows cat owners to easily navigate and select videos for their pets. The platform includes:

- User authentication system 
- Customized video recommendations 
- Search functionality
- Filtering options
- Commenting system for registered users

## Who made it?

Cattoflix was created by a team of three developers:

- Killian: Backend Developer
- Alexis: Backend Developer
- Leonardo: Front-end Genius
